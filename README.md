# Sentiment-Analysis-comparison-between-VADER-and-Roberta-pretrained-model-from-hugging-Face
This project explores two popular techniques for sentiment analysis in Python:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A lexicon-based approach that assigns sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative) to text based on pre-defined word polarities and rules.
RoBERTa Pretrained Model from Transformers: A deep learning approach utilizing a pre-trained RoBERTa model to classify sentiment based on contextual understanding of the text.

VADER (Lexicon-Based Approach):

VADER leverages a sentiment lexicon containing words and phrases associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
It analyzes the text by counting the occurrences of these sentiment-laden words and phrases.
Based on the counts and their associated polarities, VADER calculates a compound score indicating the overall sentiment of the text.

RoBERTa Pretrained Model (Deep Learning Approach):

This approach utilizes the RoBERTa model, a pre-trained transformer-based architecture from the Transformers library.
RoBERTa is fine-tuned on a massive dataset of text and sentiment labels, allowing it to capture complex relationships between words and their sentiment.
When presented with new text, RoBERTa predicts the most likely sentiment category (positive, negative, or neutral) based on its learned understanding of language.

Project Goals:

This project aims to compare and contrast the performance of VADER and RoBERTa on various sentiment analysis tasks.
We will analyze the effectiveness of each method in identifying sentiment in different types of text data (e.g., social media comments, product reviews).
We will explore potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach, considering factors like interpretability and computational efficiency.

Getting Started:

This project requires the following Python libraries:

vaderSentiment for VADER analysis
transformers for using the RoBERTa model

Future Work:

Investigate additional sentiment analysis techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Experiment with fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on domain-specific data for potentially improved performance in specific contexts.
Analyze the sentiment distribution across different datasets to gain insights into broader trends and opinions.
